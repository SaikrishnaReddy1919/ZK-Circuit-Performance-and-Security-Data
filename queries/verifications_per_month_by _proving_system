-- The point of this query is to get a list of all verification by public verifiers on Ethereum Main Chain
-- and group them by month from the first verification (2018-11-16 11:43:50 UTC) and prover system
-- The top part is the same as Verifier Contracts and grabs all contracts using the Method IDs which 
-- I believe are verifications.
